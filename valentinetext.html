        iâ€™m not writing this letter to confess my feelings for u. instead, i just want to send u my sincerest wishes
        <br><br>
        i hope you find the love u deserve
        <br><br>
        the love that teaches u how to trust other people and helps u to open urself for the love that knocks on the doors of ur heart
        <br><br>
        the love that allows u to realize ur mistakes and learn from them because love keeps no record of wrongs, love is accepting one another despite their flaws and imperfections
        <br><br>
        the love that hugs ur scars because it is one of the most beautiful things about u, marks that are enrooted into ur bones that made u more wonderful as a person
        <br><br>
        the love that gives u hope when in times of challenges, there is someone who will choose to stay with u and struggle with u, for the love that wins is conquered by two persons who are supporting each other
        <br><br>
        the love that sees galaxies in ur eyes and hears music in every heartbeat of ur heart
        <br><br>
        the love that tickles u and makes u smile on hard days and easy ones
        <br><br>
        the love that will never leave u behind and take u for granted. the love that will stand by u when u're right and correct u when u're wrong
        <br><br>
        the love that remains constant even when ur relationship is in the midst of uncertainties and struggles
        <br><br>
        what i mean is, u deserve love in ur own definition and meaning. u deserve what it can give, receive, endure and sacrifice. u are worthy of that one sure thing "LOVE"
        <br><br>
        can we go back to the days where our love was ewes ewes bablas angine
        <br><br>
        may u  be showered with love today
        <br><br>
